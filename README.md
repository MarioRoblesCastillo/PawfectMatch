PawfectMatch is a web-based Pet Adoption System developed using ASP.NET Core and C#. 
The system aims to simplify and digitize the adoption process for animal shelters and potential 
pet adopters. It allows users to browse available pets, view detailed profiles, and submit 
adoption applications. Shelter staff and admins can manage pet listings and process adoption 
requests through an admin dashboard. The system will demonstrate core Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and 
polymorphism.
